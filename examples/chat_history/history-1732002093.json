      "content": "Based on the following context: Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He won the 2024 election as the nominee of the Republican Party and is now the president-elect of the United States. He is scheduled to begin his second term on January 20, 2025.\nTrump graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. After becoming president of the family real estate business in 1971, he renamed it the Trump Organization. After a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s, he launched side ventures, mostly licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. In 2015, Trump launched a presidential campaign which led to the Trumpism movement.\nTrump won the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first U.S. president without prior military or government service. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. In his first term, he ordered a travel ban limiting refugees from Muslim-majority countries, funded the Trump wall, and implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations and signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He appointed three justices to the Supreme Court, initiated a trade war with China, and withdrew the U.S. from several international agreements. He has met with North Korean president Kim Jong Un but made no progress on denuclearization. His reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic has been heavily criticized for being slow and generally imprudent. He was impeached twice: once in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and again in 2021 for incitement of insurrection. The Senate acquitted him in both cases.\n\nAnswer this question: Did Trump win the 2024 US election?"
